//////// first lec of Js " Variables and Data Types """"""""""""

Q1. what is javaScript?
Ans. JavaScript is a scripting language that enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything else..

when node.js came its not limited of browsers only now..

extension of javaScript is .js

important Variables .

Q2. Variables in javaScript

Variables are containers for data...

Variables are containers for data it can be change as name vary means it can be changible...
 when se create varible it store in somewhere in our system memory the size may be small or larger w.r to what is in varible conatainer 

 Variable Rules
1. Variable names are case sensitive; “a” & “A” is different.
2. Only letters, digits , underScore and $ are allowed. not even space 
3. Only letters, underScore or $ should be first character
4. Reserved word cannot be Variable. alert, window, function, let , var , const etc

variable in JavaScript

let, const & var

var : Variable can be re-declared & updated. A global scope variable.

let : Variable cannot be re-declared but can be updated. A block scope variable.

const : Variable cannot be re-declared or updated. A block scope variable.

Q3. Data Types in JS..

Primitive Types : Number, String, Boolean, Undefined, Null, BigInt, Symbol // means buit in Behaviour perform by javaScript
Non Primitive Types: Objects, Arrays and Functions  // custom Behaviour.

// 1. Strings 
// a data type that helps us store an arrangement of characters.

A sequence of characters in JavaScript refers to a linear arrangement of individual characters that form a string. A character sequence can include letters, numbers, symbols, and whitespace. Each character in the sequence has a specific index or position, starting from 0 : const greeting = 'Hello, World!


4. undefine
console.log("*******Undefined**********");
// a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value.
let userName;
console.log(userName); // console show undefine bcz variable is initilized but not defined..

// const emailAddress2; we cannot create undefine type by const bcz const cannot be reassigned.
// console.log(emailAddress2); // we see error in consloe. 

5. null
an assignment value that represents no value or no object. 
The value null is written with a literal: null. null is not an identifier for a property of the global object, like undefined can be. Instead, null expresses a lack of identification, indicating that a variable points to no object. In APIs, null is often retrieved in a place where an object can be expected but no object is relevant.
use .
to indicate that a variable has no value or that an object does not exist.

6.BigInt
represent numeric values which are too large to be represented by the number primitive

7. Symbols
 Symbols are the primitive type introduced to Javascript in ECMAScript 6. Their primary purpose is to have a unique result every time they are constructed. You can think of symbols as special tokens that guarantee uniqueness (like UUID). There are two types of symbols. I will call them scoped and global.
